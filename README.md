UCSD CSE 124 Fall 2017 Homework 2 starter code

You can modify these files as long as we can type "make" on the ieng6
servers and have it build correctly.

You can use C or C++ (up to and including version C++11)

You are free to use man pages, standard libraries installed on the
ieng6 servers, any code we talk about in class, and any code from
the assigned readings/texts.  For anything else, please ask first!
